# KOEI-TECMO-game-unpack-tool
Other unpacking tools besides VitaSmith's Ghost Tools，I have created scripts for many big shots' unpacking tools, which can batch unpack KSCL, FMSG, PK, FDATA, KVS, and KNS unpacking tools



I recompiled PJ5-KSCL-Unpacker.exe and created a batch unpacking script and exe for it




I have created a batch unpacking script for PJ5-FMSG Extractor，I don't think many people like to interpret text, so I didn't create an exe



I have created a batch unpacking script and exe for LSPK-Extractor



In addition, I have created my own scripts for kvs and kns=ktss, and also compiled exe. There is no need to modify the format, as long as there are kvs and ktss inside, they can be extracted
